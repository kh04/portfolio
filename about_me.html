	<p> Hi! I'm Kara. I'm a rising high school senior interested in computer science. During sophomore year, I took an introduction to CS class, and I am currently a participant in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion program. This fall I will be taking AP computer science, and hope to continue studying CS in college. </p>
